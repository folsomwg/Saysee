# Saysee

You'll need a version of Chrome after 41 in order for this to work (when Array.prototype.includes(...)) became standard).

Type in a string of integers, and the page will tell you how many of each integer you typed in sequence.

* 555 -> Three 5's

* 55522555 -> Three 5's, Two 2's, Three 5's

* 1111111111 -> More than nine 1's
