<a href="http://www.willfolsom.com/Saysee.html">Simple one page app I coded up while on a flight.</a> You'll need a version of Chrome after 41 in order for this to work (when Array.prototype.includes(...)) became standard).

If you type in a string of integers, the app will tell you how many of each integer you typed in sequence.


555 -> Three 5's

55522555 -> Three 5's, Two 2's, Three 5's

1111111111 -> More than nine 1's
